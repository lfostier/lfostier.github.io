abstract: The initial step of biofilm formation is bacteria attachment to biotic or
  abiotic surfaces and other bacteria through intra or interspecies interactions.
  Adhesion can be influenced by physicochemical conditions of the environment, such
  as iron. There is no available mathematical model of bacterial attachment giving
  realistic initiation rather than random adhesion. We describe a simple stochastic
  attachment model, from the simplest case in two dimensions with one bacterial species
  attaching on a homogeneous flat surface to more complex situations, with either
  several bacterial species, inhomogeneous or non-flat surfaces, or in three dimensions.
  The model depends on attachment probabilities (on the surface, laterally, or vertically
  on bacteria). Effects of each of these parameters were analyzed. This mathematical
  model is then applied to experimental oral microcolonies of Porphyromonas gingivalis,
  Streptococcus gordonii, and Treponema denticola, either as mono-, two, or three
  species, under different iron concentrations. The model allows to characterize the
  adhesion of three bacterial species and explore the effect of iron on attachment.
  This model appears as a powerful tool for initial attachment analysis of bacterial
  species. It will enable further modeling of biofilm formation in later steps with
  biofilm initialization more relevant to real-life subgingival biofilms.
