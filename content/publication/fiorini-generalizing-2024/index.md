abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a widely studied field of research that aims
  to infer symbolic expressions from data. A popular approach for SR is the Sparse
  Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (sindy) framework, which uses sparse
  regression to identify governing equations from data. This study introduces an enhanced
  method, Nested SINDy, that aims to increase the expressivity of the SINDy approach
  thanks to a nested structure. Indeed, traditional symbolic regression and system
  identification methods often fail with complex systems that cannot be easily described
  analytically. Nested SINDy builds on the SINDy framework by introducing additional
  layers before and after the core SINDy layer. This allows the method to identify
  symbolic representations for a wider range of systems, including those with compositions
  and products of functions. We demonstrate the ability of the Nested SINDy approach
  to accurately find symbolic expressions for simple systems, such as basic trigonometric
  functions, and sparse (false but accurate) analytical representations for more complex
  systems. Our results highlight Nested SINDy's potential as a tool for symbolic regression,
  surpassing the traditional SINDy approach in terms of expressivity. However, we
  also note the challenges in the optimization process for Nested SINDy and suggest
  future research directions, including the designing of a more robust methodology
  for the optimization process. This study proves that Nested SINDy can effectively
  discover symbolic representations of dynamical systems from data, offering new opportunities
  for understanding complex systems through data-driven methods.
