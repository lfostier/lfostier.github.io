 #   summary: |
 #     I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I'm currently a PhD candidate at INRAE in applied mathematics for biology. My thesis is about the modelling of the female fish germ cell population.
